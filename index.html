            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language. Inside a
                host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
                environment to provide
                programmatic control over them.</p>

            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements
                such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of
                purposes by
                supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document Object Model
                    (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form
                    and respond to user
                    events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>

                <li>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                    on a server. For
                    example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
                    continuity of information
                    from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the
                    main page about
                    JavaScript.</li>

            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>

            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language
                resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
                Java expression
                syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
                from LiveScript to
                JavaScript</p>

            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
                system based
                on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a
                prototype-based
                object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
                dynamic
                inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports
                functions without any
                special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed
                methods.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                classes, and
                methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you
                do not have to
                implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World_Example">
            <header>Hello World Example</header>

            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
                code:</p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World");
                </code>
            </pre>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables_In_Javascript">
            <header>Variables In JavaScript</header>
            <p>Most useful programs need to track a value as it changes over the course of the program, undergoing
                different operations
                as called for by your program's intended tasks.</p>

            <p>The easiest way to go about that in your program is to assign a value to a symbolic container, called a
                variable -- so
                called because the value in this container can vary over time as needed.</p>

            <p>In some programming languages, you declare a variable (container) to hold a specific type of value, such
                as number or
                string. Static typing, otherwise known as type enforcement, is typically cited as a benefit for program
                correctness by
                preventing unintended value conversions.</p>

            <p>Other languages emphasize types for values instead of variables. Weak typing, otherwise known as dynamic
                typing, allows
                a variable to hold any type of value at any time. It's typically cited as a benefit for program
                flexibility by allowing
                a single variable to represent a value no matter what type form that value may take at any given moment
                in the program's
                logic flow.</p>

            <p>JavaScript uses the latter approach, dynamic typing, meaning variables can hold values of any type
                without any type
                enforcement.</p>

            <p>As mentioned earlier, we declare a variable using the <strong>var statement</strong> -- notice there's no
                other
                type information in the
                declaration. Consider this simple program:</p>

            <pre><span class="pl-k">var</span> <span class="pl-s1">amount</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-c1">99.99</span><span class="pl-kos">;</span>
                    
                    <span class="pl-s1">amount</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">amount</span> * <span class="pl-c1">2</span><span class="pl-kos">;</span>
                    
                    <span class="pl-smi">console</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-en">log</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span> <span class="pl-s1">amount</span> <span class="pl-kos">)</span><span class="pl-kos">;</span>		<span class="pl-c">// 199.98</span>
                    
                    <span class="pl-c">// convert `amount` to a string, and</span>
                    <span class="pl-c">// add "$" on the beginning</span>
                    <span class="pl-s1">amount</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s">"$"</span> <span class="pl-c1">+</span> <span class="pl-v">String</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span> <span class="pl-s1">amount</span> <span class="pl-kos">)</span><span class="pl-kos">;</span>
                    
                    <span class="pl-smi">console</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-en">log</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span> <span class="pl-s1">amount</span> <span class="pl-kos">)</span><span class="pl-kos">;</span>		<span class="pl-c">// "$199.98"</span></pre>
